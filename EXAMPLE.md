# ReaperDAW.Chiptune.Example
Example of usage of ReaperDAW.Chiptune preset.

**My example song:**
https://soundcloud.com/ji-kuba-1/reaper-tax

**Making chiptune song with ReaperDAW.Chiptune steps:**
* Write song. You can use Guitar Pro or free TuxGuitar (https://sourceforge.net/projects/tuxguitar/). If you wrote whole song in Reaper DAW ignore next step.
* Export to MIDI and import to Reaper DAW (Insert -> Media file) 
* Explode drums (right click on drum track -> Item processing -> Explode MIDI item by note row (pitch))
* Delete empty drum tracks.
* Assign Magical 8bit Plug VST to each track
* Chose right setup from preset menu

**Note correction**

Default drum notes are not sound right with this preset. Best note values for drums:
* Kick: E3
* Snare: B3
* Open Hi-Hat: B3
* Crash cymbal 1: C#3
* Crash cymbal 2: A3
* Splash cymbal: G3

**Snare drum correction**

You can also duplicate snare drum track and assign Snare-Base preset to it. This will improve sound of snare drum (more bass sound).

**Tom-tom drum**

Tom-tom drum sound it's basically kick drum sound but has higher note. 

**Guitar correction**

Guitars are sound better if default notes are set one octave higher.
